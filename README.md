# Blink Tic Tac Toe

## Tech Stack
- React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Emoji Categories
- Animals: 🐶, 🐱, 🦊
- Food: 🍎, 🍕, 🍔
- Sports: ⚽, 🏀, 🏈

## Vanishing Feature Implementation
Each player can have only 3 emojis on the board at a time. When a player places a new emoji and already has 3 on the board, the oldest emoji placed by that player vanishes (is removed from the board). This is done by maintaining arrays of positions for each player and shifting the oldest position off the board before adding the new emoji.

## Potential Improvements (With More Time)
- Add animations for the emoji vanishing and placing.
- Improve UX by showing whose emoji is which (maybe with colors or labels).
- Add sound effects or visual feedback for turns and winning.
- Implement AI for single-player mode.
- Add better accessibility features for screen readers.
- Store game state in localStorage to preserve progress on refresh.
